# Lab: Intelligence Agency Management System

Web application written in C# using ASP.NET MVC and Entity Framework with two MySql databases connected (one for users, the other is the system's core knowladge base and 
its diagram can bee seen below). Database-first approah was used. The idea is to automate Intelligence Agency, make it easier to create, change, explore and delete records of 
workers, departments, operations, tasks and much more. 

The project features 16 controllers, two databases, import and export capabilities with little NLP, visualisation tools, management tools etc. 

You can learn much more about the whole cycle of development in the report (contact the author).

## Database
Here you can see the diagram of the main database. It's rather a "detailed plan", not the ultimate architecture, but it's the one by which the development has been driven.
More about the architectures can be explored in the report the author has composed at the end of the project (contact the author).

## Import and export of records
The application features import and export engines. While export is quite straightforward, neat and intuitive, export allows for various forms of inputs,
even with mistakes. The columns can be shuffled and reasonably misnamed, the same concerns most entries â€” simple NLP resolution engine is applied
and if misspellings still allow to uniquelly identify subjects autocorrect is applied. More can be discovered in the report (contact the author).
